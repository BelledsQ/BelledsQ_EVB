Building audio driver
---------------------

For Virian:
ar7240_i2s is not built/included by default.
Makefile.ar7240_emu needs to be modified for the audio driver to be built and included as part of fs.
To build - just add "i2s_build" to 'Makefile.ar7240_emu'

For Wasp:
ath_i2s is not built/included by default.
Makefile.db12x needs to be modified for the audio driver to be built and included as part of fs.
To build - just add "i2s_build" to 'Makefile.db12x' and add "CONFIG_I2S=1" to the make command.
